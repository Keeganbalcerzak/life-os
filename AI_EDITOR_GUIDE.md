# AI Editor Operating Guide

Welcome! Before you start editing Life OS, please follow these guardrails so every AI contributor works from the same playbook.

## Prep Work
- Read `README.md` to understand the project goals, setup, and coding conventions.
- Read `FEATURES_ROADMAP.md` so you know which features are complete, in-flight, or pending.

## Updating the Roadmap
- When you fully deliver a roadmap item, update its line in `FEATURES_ROADMAP.md` with a ✅ checkmark.
- Only mark items as complete after the feature is implemented, tested, and merged (or otherwise shipped).
- If progress is partial, leave the roadmap line as-is; use your summary or commit message to note what remains.

## Communication
- Reference roadmap IDs (for example, `1.1.2.1`) in your summaries so others can trace the work.
- Mention any roadmap updates you made, plus follow-up work that still needs attention.

## Coding Consistency
- Follow the formatting, commenting, and architectural conventions spelled out in `README.md`.
- When uncertain about naming or structure, look at existing patterns in the repository before inventing new ones.

Thanks for keeping the documentation and roadmap accurate for the next editor!
